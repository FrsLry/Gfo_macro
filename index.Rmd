# The Great Acceleration

* Since the 50's human population and activities have not only linearly increased, but exponentially increased (i.e. acceleration)

* Exponential growth of GDP is **coupled** with an exponential impact on ecosystems through intensive agriculture, deforestation, transportation, urbanization...

* Exponential growth of GDP is the aim of every national economy

# Acceleration and its decomposition

* Change in abundance $\Delta N$ = increase or decrease

* Change in yearly growth rate $\Delta g$ = acceleration or deceleration

* $\Delta g$ is the difference between change in recruitment rate $\Delta r$ and loss rate $\Delta l$

* Change in yearly growth rate $\Delta g$ = acceleration or deceleration

* $\Delta g$ is the difference between change in recruitment rate $\Delta r$ and loss rate $\Delta l$

.center[

<br>

### Problem

A value of $\Delta g$ can be the results of infinite combinations of $\Delta r$ and $\Delta l$

From a conservation perspective, it is important to know which process, between $\Delta r$ and $\Delta l$, is the driving force of the temporal dynamic

# Results

# Trend in abundance

* Continental decline: 96% of the route with negative $\Delta N$

* Hot-spots in Texas, Florida, Delaware and New Jersey

* Average decline per route of 22%

.center[
```{r, out.width="100%"}

```
]

---

# Acceleration of the decline

* As $\Delta N$ is mostly negative, mapping $\Delta g$ shows acceleration or deceleration of the decline

* At the continental scale, no trend toward acceleration (42%) or deceleration (58%)

* Hot-spots of acceleration in Midwest, California and Mid Atlantic regions

# Take home messages

<br><br>

* The decline of bird is continental, with an average of 22% (in line with Rosenberg. *et al.*, 2019)

* The decline is accelerating where human activities take place (Midwest, California and Mid Atlantic)

* Decrease in recruitment rate is the main process in Mid Atlantic, and increase in loss rate in Midwest and California

* 96% of species and 100% of families with increasing abundance are undergoing a decline in recruitment rate

* Enhancing recruitment rate should be considered in conservation policies

---

# Caveats

* **Propagation of uncertainty, from per species model, to overall abundance:**

I stacked the abundance of each per species model using the mean of the posterior distributions. The uncertainty of the parameters are not propagated into the trends.

**Are there any experts in Bayesian statistics or occupancy models in this room?**

**Please, let's have a chat! **

<br>

* **Density dependence not considered:** the fact that $\Delta r$ is negative for most of the increasing species could be an artefact of the occupancy models? Accounting for density dependence may change this result?
